# Project Euler solutions
This repository contains some of the first 100 exercices from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). In case you don't know Project Euler, it is a great repository of programming exercices where it is very important to apply mathematical knowledge.

Most of these exercices [are resolved using JavaScript](https://github.com/arialdev/Project-Euler/tree/main/js), but my idea is to eventually use other programming languages.

These solutions may not the best ones. I'm not a genius, I'm just a guy who loves programming and loves this kind of challenges. However, I have put a lot of effort to make these solutions decent at least. There are some of them which I'm very proud of, and other ones which I know I couldn't find the best solution yet.

 If you have any suggestion or you may want to ask me anything, please, feel free to contact me on my social networks. All the relevant links are pinned on [my profile](https://github.com/arialdev).
